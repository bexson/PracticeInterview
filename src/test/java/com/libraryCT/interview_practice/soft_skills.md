# 1 - What is your team size ? (Tell me about your team ?) 

#### ==> We have 5 developers and 3 testers , 1 PO Khrystyna , 1 BA Nikola , 1 SM Mariana

# 2 - Is this a qa only in your team ?

#### ==> No. We have 2 qa testers and 1 manual. 


# 3 - How long is your sprint ?

#### ==> 1 sprint is 2 weeks.  

# 4 - Which scrum ceremonies you attend ?

#### ==> I attend Grooming meeting(Thursday), Sprint Planning(Friday), Daily standUp , Sprint Demo, Sprint Retrospective. 
    new sprint starts at Monday.

#### ==> Grooming meeting hosted by PO, scrum team is involved , and we give points for each user story by using Fibonacci Sequence.

- Before the meeting PO Prioritize the product backlog
- Developers and testers explain why did we give such a point, and we discuss.
- It takes around 2 hrs.
- We have this meeting once at the beginning of each sprint.

#### ==> At Sprint Planning meeting PO take user stories from product backlog to sprint backlog, we prioritize estimated user story, we plan for upcoming 1 sprint, and we assign the user stories. 
- We count our capacity and velocity for the sprint.
- It takes around 2 hrs.
- Happens after grooming meeting.


      Capacity - total num of dev team - 2 days for the meetings(Planning & Grooming) = numOfVelocity
      Capacity - total days one team has to work.
      Velocity - total user story points one team can finish in a sprint
      Velocity = team capacity - day off

#### ==> Daily StandUp happens every day. We answer 3 questions : 
1) What did I do yesterday ? 
2) What am I going to do today ?
3) Is there any impediment ? Blocker ? Problem?
- It hosted by Scrum Master.
- Dev team + Scrum master are involved.
- It takes around 15 minutes
###### Why this meeting important ? - To keep up to date each other to be more productive.

#### ==> Sprint Demo meeting hosted by PO. Scrum team and Costumer are involved. 
- Developers and we (testers) demonstrate our work that we've done during the sprint to PO and client. 
- This meeting happens once at the end of the sprint.
- Takes around 2 hrs.

#### ==> Sprint Retrospective hosted by SM. Dev team and Scrum master are involved. We answer 3 questions : 
- What went well ?
- What was not going well ?
- How can we improve ?
- This meeting happens at the end of the sprint, after Demo meeting.
- Takes around 1 hour.

# 5 - Which scrum meeting is the most important for you ?

#### ==> Sprint planning is the most important for me. Because we prioritize the user story, we estimate the total afford, and we have to say is it capable for our team to finish during sprint or not. So if our estimation is wrong, it can affect our deadline.

#### ==> Also, I have a habit which is before every planning meeting I just look at the user stories and try to understand the user stories before the meeting. It is like little preparation for me. And when planning meeting starts , the PO will explain these user stories , so that If I have any questions, I can ask just ask my question, and I will get my answer just right away.
#### ==> So, this way it will be really productive for me. Later on those user stories assigned to me during the sprint I am not going to be too stressed out or trying to email to PO or BA to ask those question coz I have an idea what is that about. 

#### ==> Or, even it is better for me to estimate the effort I need or in what period of time I can test those user stories. 

#### ==> So, it is good point for me to do such a homework before planning meeting.

#### ==> extra: Also I like it , coz we talk, encourage with each other

# 6 - What is your communication with PO, in what circumstances you communicate with him/her ? 

#### ==> Actually , if developer doesn't agree with me about a  bug , I can quickly reach out PO and explain developer's and mine opinion and basically wait for his final decision. 

#### ==> Or if I still have any questions about US, maybe like not clear for me after BA's answer , I can then ask PO

# 7 - I know every company implements differently, but what is the best PO's responsibilities ? 

#### ==> PO plays important role in the project. The PO is the person who talk with client and know the project really well. If he doesn't know he is not going to prioritize user stories properly, he should know the team size, structure so that he can assign the user stories properly.

# 8 - What does SM do in your project ? 

#### ==> Scrum Master is the person , who should facilitate the scrum team , process, meetings , remove the impediments. He is making sure the team following the scrum role or not.

# 

        What is Agile ?
        Agile is software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers.
        Communication , face - to - face collaboration.

# 9 - Did you work in an Agile team ? What are the things you liked about Agile ?

#### ==> Yep, definitely I worked in Agile/Scrum. Because in Agile the changes are welcome, I like satisfaction of the client, daily team work, communication within the team, the continues feedback from users, deliver the product frequently, face-to-face conversation, self-organized team. Agile is also flexible.    

#### ==> Disadvantages of agile : 1) flexibility. Requirements from the client can change anytime and always, so basically whole business logic will change. And this is a disadvantage. And meetings can be managed not properly. Like in one day planning demo meeting in 1 day, and it can impact that other teammates can have a daily tasks.  

# 10 - Agile or Waterfall, which one do you prefer ?

#### ==> Actually , I know both of them, they both have advantages and disadvantages. I prefer to work on both of them. And I am suitable for any environment.

# 11 - Do you prefer automation or manual testing ? 

#### ==> I prefer both of them. I know how to test manually and automatically, so they both have advantages and disadvantages. So, both of them.

        Scrum - I can control the time, because I'm giving points. 1 point = 1 day = 8 hrs. 
        Kanban - I can't , everyone can see my work for 1 day, there is no points 

        There are multiple team works on this project. My team is one of that team who focus on filtering module.

# 12 - What is an Epic ?

#### ==> Epic is a large user story, that we can break it down for small user stories to develop and test. 

# 13 - What do you do when you have too many stories left, and the sprint is ending soon ? 

#### ==> Yes, so in my current project we had this kind of issues , not always , but occasionally coz of some environment issues, or other technical issues, or one of our team member left the project suddenly we have to cover that team member rest of the  responsibilities. In that case it is kinda hard to meet the deadline. But my approach is I like to work hard , extra. I always volunteer to work during the weekend, I put in my name to the team lead , whenever he asks, so I try to complete those user stories before the sprint is ending. 
? -> WHY ? > Well, I want to help my team.

#### ==> I always prioritize my user stories. Every day I come , I check how many tasks are done , how many tasks left for the sprint. I prioritize them. So, in that case I always meet the deadline and never miss any user stories.

# 14 - What was your definition of ready and definition of Done in your team ? 
- Well, for me as a tester \/
  
    Definition of Ready ( What kind of conditions should be ready before testing )
- Definition of Ready : 
#### ==> Requirements should be clear (user story and acceptance criteria)
#### ==> After that, Scenarios should be ready.  
#### ==> Test data should be ready.
#### ==> Environment should be ready
    Definition of Done (What kind of conditions should be done to say that user story is done). Basically we need to close the sprint. 
- Definition of Done:

#### ==> So, it is the end of the sprint, I check all my user stories, test cases , test execution, bug ticket, everything. All test cases pure review done.
#### ==> Code review is done. 
#### ==> All tests that I've done should be passed. If failed ==> that means that there is a bug, then bug ticket should be closed.
    Bug closed means I have to go back to failed tests and make it test on Jira.    
#### ==> Test reports should be generated
#### ==> All related ticket should be linked to the user story. 

# 15 - What is the Definition of Ready and Definition of Done for PO ?
- Definition of Ready : 
#### ==> All about user story, so user story should be created
#### ==> Acceptance criteria should be attached to the user story
#### ==> Is there any extra document that we can attach to that specific user story 
#### ==> Is that ready for testing , for development or not 

# 16 - How many environments do you have ? and which environment do you test ? 

#### ==> I have 4 environments : dev environment , multiple test environment , staging , production

#### ==> So in my team we have qa test environment , and most of the time for functional testing we are going with that qa test env , but other test teams they have their own specific  environments , and sometimes we can use their environments to check the functionality as well. Just for double-checking. And we use UAT env. Staging env mostly for regression for our team, because this env more close to production env. Production is real environment before release. 

# 17 - What are your responsibilities ? 
- mention that I'm involved in hotfix

#### ==>
#### ==>
#### ==>

# 18 - What are your day-to-day activities ? 
1. I wake up early, check the email, I just want to know do I have any meetings scheduled for today or not.
By the email, I can see the tasks on Jira.(for meeting, bug ticket, new assignment)
3. Daily stand-up meeting at 10 am. (15-30 minutes)
4. Either I work on my current ticket / I will work on new user story ticket / maintain my framework / code review  
4. bug scrub meeting (review the bug, dev , testers who open a bug should join this meeting, SM hosts this meeting)

#### ==> Tasks like if I have failed test cases , I open a bug ticket assigned to developer, if developer fix it , the status should be changed to **done** from **work in progress**

#### ==> or if any user story assigned to me or not, if I get user story ---> I get an email notification. Team lead assigns the user story for us.

# 19 - How do you run regression ?
==> Hello, Regression test is used to confirm that a recent code change or any new feature has not adversely affected existing features.

==> In my team, we have minor regression which we run whenever new functionality added to our application,  and we need to make sure that it will collaborate with the whole product together, so in that case we run our minor regression to see how the application will behave in such situation, and major regression: it re-executing all the test cases to ensure all existing and new functionalities works fine together.

==> Our minor regression runs at the end of each sprint (1 sprint = 2 weeks)
- we run all our automated scenarios as minor regression, we have approximately 600 scenarios.
- it takes around 45 minutes to run.

==> Our major regression runs before each release, our release happens - every 2 months
==> it takes around 6 and a half - 7 hours and the whole team needs to be present in that time.
==> We have ~ 600 test cases 

# 20 - SDLC vs STLC ? 
#### ==> STLC it is a process in SDLC.
#### ==> SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.
1. SDLC starts from the requirement gathering. Where PO gather the requirement from the client. 
2. Designing. Designers design the app and documents.
3. Development. This is the actual writing of the program. Where developers develop and creates the application.
4. Testing. Different types of testers will work here to test the application to make sure it meets the requirements and to make sure we are building the bug-free application.
After that Testing life cycle is starting.
5. Deployment phase. The application is made available to users. Here app will be deployed to the market for the end users to use the app.
6. Maintaining. We maintain the app. It means if any bugs found from the end users or client wants to add new changes. Or we want to make sure the app running smoothly, so we need to maintain , which means we need to repeat the sdlc life cycle.

#### ==> STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle , It is an integral part of SDLC , but it deals only with the testing phases.
- STLC starts as soon as requirements are defined or SRD (Software Requirement Document) is shared by stakeholders.
- As soon as the development phase is over, the testers are ready with test cases and start with execution.
- STLC has the different phases , which I wanna mention right now :
1. Requirement analysis -  where quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested. If anything is missing or not understandable then quality assurance team meets with the stakeholders to better understand the detail knowledge of requirement.
2. Test Planning: is most efficient phase of STLC where all testing plans are defined. In this phase manager of the testing team calculates estimated effort and cost for the testing work. 
3. Test Case Development: In this phase testing team note down the detailed test cases. Testing team also prepare the required test data for the testing. When the test cases are prepared then they are reviewed by quality assurance team.
4. Test Environment Setup:  Basically test environment decides the conditions on which software is tested. Test team may not be involved in this activity if the development team provides the test environment
5. Test Execution: After the test case development and test environment setup, test execution phase gets started. In this phase testing team start executing test cases based on prepared test cases in the earlier step.
6. Test Closure: This is the last stage of STLC in which the process of testing is analyzed.

- Each of these stages has a definite Entry and Exit criteria, Activities & Deliverables associated with it.
- Entry Criteria: Entry Criteria gives the prerequisite items that must be completed before testing can begin.
- Exit Criteria: Exit Criteria defines the items that must be completed before testing can be concluded
