# How do you run regression ?
==> Hello, Regression test is used to confirm that a recent code change or any new feature has not adversely affected existing features.

==> In my team, we have minor regression which we run whenever new functionality added to our application and we need to make sure that it will collaborate with the whole product together, so in that case we run our minor regression to see how the application will behave in such situation, and major regression: it re-executing all the test cases to ensure all existing and new functionalities works fine together.

==> Our minor regression runs at the end of each sprint (1 sprint = 2 weeks)
- we run all our automated scenarios as minor regression, we have approximately 600 scenarios.
- it takes around 45 minutes to run.

==> Our major regression runs before each release, our release happens - every 2 months
==> it takes around 6 and a half - 7 hours and the whole team needs to be present in that time.
==> We have ~ 600 test cases
