# 3 - How long is your sprint ?

#### ==> 1 sprint is 2 weeks.  

# 4 - Which scrum ceremonies you attend ?

#### ==> I attend Grooming meeting(Thursday), Sprint Planning(Friday), Daily standUp , Sprint Demo(), Sprint Retrospective. 
    new sprint starts at Monday.

#### ==> Grooming meeting hosted by PO, scrum team is involved , and we estimate points for each user story by using Fibonacci Sequence.

- Before the meeting PO Prioritize the product backlog
- Developers and testers explain why did we give such a point, and we discuss.
- It takes around 2 hrs.
- We have this meeting once at the beginning of each sprint.

#### ==> At Sprint Planning meeting PO take user stories from product backlog to sprint backlog, we plan for upcoming 1 sprint, and we assign the user stories. 
- We count our capacity and velocity for the sprint.


      Capacity - total num of dev team - 2 days for the meetings(Planning & Grooming) = numOfVelocity
      Capacity - total days one team has to work.
      Velocity - total user story points one team can finish in a sprint
      Velocity = team capacity - day off

#### ==> Daily StandUp happens every day. We answer 3 questions : 
1) What did I do yesterday ? 
2) What am I going to do today ?
3) Is there any impediment ? Blocker ? Problem?
- It hosted by Scrum Master.
- Dev team + Scrum master are involved.
- It takes around 15 minutes
###### Why this meeting important ? - To keep up to date each other to achieve more productive.

#### ==> Sprint Demo meeting hosted by PO. Scrum team and Costumer are involved. 
- Developers and we (testers) demonstrate our work that we've done during the sprint to PO and client. 
- This meeting happens once at the end of the sprint.

#### ==> Sprint Retrospective hosted by SM. Dev team and Scrum master are involved. We answer 3 questions : 
- What went well ?
- What was not going well ?
- How can we improve ?
- This meeting happens at the end of the sprint, after Demo meeting.

# 5 - Which scrum meeting is the most important for you ?

#### ==> Sprint planning is the most important for me. Because we prioritize the user story, we estimate the total afford, and we have to say is it capable for our team to finish during sprint or not. So if our estimation is wrong, it can affect our deadline.

#### ==> Also, I have a habit which is before every planning meeting I just look at the user stories and try to understand the user stories before the meeting. It is like little preparation for me. And when planning meeting starts , the PO will explain these user stories , so that If I have any questions, I can ask just ask my question, and I will get my answer just right away.
#### ==> So, this way it will be really productive for me. Later on those user stories assigned me during the sprint I am not going to be too stressed out or trying to email to PO or BA to ask those question coz I have an idea what is that about. 

#### ==> Or, even it is better for me to estimate the effort I need or in what period of time I can test those user stories. 

#### ==> So, it is good point for me to do such a homework before planning meeting.

#  - How do you run regression ?
==> Hello, Regression test is used to confirm that a recent code change or any new feature has not adversely affected existing features.

==> In my team, we have minor regression which we run whenever new functionality added to our application,  and we need to make sure that it will collaborate with the whole product together, so in that case we run our minor regression to see how the application will behave in such situation, and major regression: it re-executing all the test cases to ensure all existing and new functionalities works fine together.

==> Our minor regression runs at the end of each sprint (1 sprint = 2 weeks)
- we run all our automated scenarios as minor regression, we have approximately 600 scenarios.
- it takes around 45 minutes to run.

==> Our major regression runs before each release, our release happens - every 2 months
==> it takes around 6 and a half - 7 hours and the whole team needs to be present in that time.
==> We have ~ 600 test cases
