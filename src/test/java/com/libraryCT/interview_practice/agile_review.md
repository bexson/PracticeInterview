# What is User Story ? 

- Short, simple descriptions of a feature or features told from the costumer.


# How do we know if this is a good user story?
- INVEST criteria

- Independent: Should be self-contained in a way that allows to be released without depending on one another.
- Negotiable: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation. User story should not be written like contract.
- Valuable: Delivers value to end user.
- Estimable: User stories have to be able to be estimated, so it can be properly prioritized and fit into sprints.
- Small: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in about 3 to 4 days.
- Testable: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.

# What is Acceptance Criteria ? 

- are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other system.
-  They are unique for each user story and define the feature behavior from the end-userâ€™s perspective.


# How do I estimate the point ? 
54;42
for example, I have a simple user story :
- as a user I should be able to login amazon home page
- so it doesn't take that much time 

scenarios:

1) amazon home page
2. valid credentials 
3. invalid credentials
 
and I have complicated user story : 
- as a user I should be able to purchase an item on amazon.com

scenarios:
1. valid bank card info
2. invalid bank information
3. gift card
4. credit card
5. paypal
6. crypto
7. Apple Pay
8. Is it stored exactly same in back end testing
9. If shipping address is wrong is system still working properly like give error message, and do just move to next page or not


# In order to give point : 
- **I need to analyze user story and acceptance criteria, so I can give 1 point for analyzing the user story**
- **scenario and test case (test data) -->so,  I can give 1 point**
- **execute test + bug report -->So, I can give 1 point for that too**


# What is hotfix ? 
- Hotfix means if something happened in production, 1 any issue in production. And as long as hotfix is finished , if developer fixed it , we immediately just retesting it and release.
- And if we are retesting this hotfix part, our team always selects the most experienced knowledgeable tester to join to the hotfix and make sure everything is good to go for the productions.   

# What is Epic ? 
- It is the biggest user stories. It is almost everything about one project.
          
      For instance : As customer I should be able to buy from Amazon, so I don't have to go to local stores.

# What is Feature ? 
- It is multiple user stories that you can put together, and it becomes stand-alone component of one application.
    
      For ex: As amazon prime member I should be able to stream movies online, so I don't have to use netflix. 

# What is Rat Hole ? 
- It is in the meeting when team getting in too much argument and wasting time we call it rat hole. As soon as someone says it is Rat Hole we should stop arguing. 

# What is Parking Lot Item ? 
- It is a valid problem in the meeting , but it is your specific problem, so if you keep people discussing your problem in the meeting you are wasting team's time, so we call it **Parking lot item**. You should discuss those items after meeting.

# What is QA Traceability metrics or just QA metrics ?
- So it is when we track the user stories are covered with enough test cases or not to make sure all the user stories are covered or not with enough scenarios. 
- Why do we do this ? Because we need to know user stories are covered with enough scenarios or not. Is something left or missing.

# Bug ?

- There is a user story that checks the dropdown list and user should be able to select multiple dropdowns . When I check this user story on UI , somehow  I found that user is able to select those options , but 1 by 1 , not once. But it should be better if user can select those dropdowns in one shot. They just click the dropdowns and go to the next page. But it is not working that way, if user selects 1 dropdown option then he should go back, click dropdown and select again and go back. So this is not user-friendly, so as a user I am not happy with that, and I opened a bug. But developer rejected, he said it is not the requirement, it is not mentioning in the requirement , there is nothing says that the user should be able to select multiple options at once, there is no that word. And I go back to my desktop, and in his perspective he is right, based on what he is doing on that user story, but from my perspective as end user I don't like that behaviour. I wanna do multiple options in 1 shot , so I emailed my PO, since he is my team lead , I explained my point of view, that as end user I will be not happy, and I explained developer's opinion as well. He immediately sent back email to me, by saying let's have a quick meeting. I did the meeting I demo it and showed and explained them, and they immediately updated the user story and developer fixed the issues, and we were good to go.

# Conflict ?

- So I found a bug, but developer didn't agree, and we had a disagreement, but how I solved. My approach is I emailed to PO, team lead and explained them in right perspective, and they agreed with that. So , we made application better with that.

# Achievements 

- Well, I don't have big achievements. But I have small things that I can mention. One day I found small issues on user story. Even tho it is a small things I corrected , I collaborated with PO and ended up, update the user story. And from that PO had a great impression on me. On one of the retro meetings they just talked about these things. Everyone said thank you for your hard work.




# Questions for the interviewers at the end ?
