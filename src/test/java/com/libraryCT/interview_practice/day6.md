- Set : 
  - Does NOT have index. Does not accept duplicates

- Map :
  - Data structure based on key+value pairs
  - Map interface does not extend Collection interface
  - It may contain duplicate values but keys are always unique.

## 4 - What is the length of the EMPTY and null string ?
- Null means nothing. It's just a literal.
- Null is the value of reference variable. But 
- Empty string is blank. It gives the length=0. 
- Empty string is a blank value, means the string does not have anything.
